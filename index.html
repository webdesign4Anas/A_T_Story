                <span class="comments">On 30th- October- 2024.</span>
                <br> I don’t know how I thought of this, but I suddenly found myself deciding, “I’m going to see her now 😂♥.”  I found myself getting dressed and heading to a liver sandwich cart, thinking you'd like it more than shawarma. Then I kept running, as I told you, to catch a ride. It was a race for who would get there first😂. I got off at a gate where there was no one around, then took a tuk-tuk to reach your place. We walked through a deserted path, just fields around us, and I thought I might actually get kidnapped😂. Finally, I called and told you I had arrived, but you were so stubborn that you didn’t believe me until you came down and saw me😂. I’ll never forget the shock and surprise on your face😂♥. <br>

                <br>Suddenly, I realized I had done exactly what I wanted and forgot all the exhaustion I felt just to reach your town, Tameyah😂خرا, and see you. The hardest part of that day was heading back to 6th of October City. You even got me to ride a big truck to get home, all to make sure I got back safely. I didn’t reach home until 4 AM, but it’s okay—all of this is worth it just to see you happy and okay. </br>
                
                <br>May God give you patience with me because the road with me is tough😂, and you’ll have a hard time. But truly, may God be with you.😂 ♥<br>
<br>                
                <br>
